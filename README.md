#### The Blendtec Dev Team

# Frontend Developer Test

Thank you for you interest in Blendtec's Development Team. While we all work at multiple levels of the stack this simple test will help us understand your skills and familiarity with good coding practices in front end development.

## Instructions

### 1. Fork this Repository

A working knowledge of Git is required for working at Blendtec. If you are not familiar with Git you can teach yourself easily. Refer to the (online Git book)[http://git-scm.com/book].

### 2. Complete the User Stories (below)

At Blendtec we strive to work in a more agile environment. If you are unfamiliar with Agile or Scrum refer to Wikipedia: (Agile software development)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development] and (Scrum)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)]; and Google.

In short, a User story is a specific, plain English description of a user's needs from the user's perspective.

Please complete the user stories below with at least one commit per user story. Detailed commit messages describing functionality created or improved will help us learn how you work.

Optional, use a branching strategy and merge a completed story all at once.

### 3. Additional Improvements

The existing code is deliberately bare bones and the page is deliberately lacking design. This is an opportunity for you to shine. Whether is it by implementing best practices, task runners or CSS pre/post processors or cleaning up the code, or by adding a touch of your design. Keep the design clean and simple. Refer to some of the clean and simple designs on (www.blendtec.com)[http://www.blendtec.com] for examples and color schemes.

Again, make specific and detailed commit messages for each improvement. Make sure to include why it is an improvement in your eyes.

We are not judging design but rather would like to see initiative.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

After you have completed your changes, please submit a pull request. All candidates will have their pull request reviewed and have an opportunity for feedback.

## User Stories

### 1. Header Hero

As a User I want to see a nice branded Hero with the Header text centered in the Hero, and the Hero background image muted with a red overlay. See (screenshot)[screenshot-hero.png]

Header text should be white on the red background. Feel free to look at some of the miscellaneous pages on Blendtec.com. But write your own code, and feel free to do it differently.

### 2. Claim Form box

As a User I would like the Warranty Claim form emphasized in a box to set it off from the helpful content.

See (screenshot)[screenshot-contentbox.png].

### 3. Form formatted

As a User I would like a nice easy to read and use form to submit my warranty claim.

Please make it a two column form with labels above the inputs. See (screenshot)[screenshot-form.png]. The text area should be full width. The three date inputs should as a unit span the full width.

### 4. Date Validation

As a User I would like the form to warn me and prevent submission if I enter a date that is more than 10 years in the past (longer than our longest warranty) or is in the future.

Please display the error message beneath the appropriate input(s) and have the error clear as soon as they fix the problem without resubmitting.

### 5. Mobile Responsive Layout

As a User I would like the page to look good on and be optimized for my device whatever it's size and the form is easy to fill out.

Feel free to take liberties on page layout and the form layout, but the mobile style should match the full width version appropriately.

## Questions

If you have questions please submit an issue to this repository. We will respond as soon as possible.
